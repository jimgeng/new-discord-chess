# Discord Chess Bot

I worked on this chess bot as a personal project in 2021. This bot is allows two separate users of the Discord chat platform to play chess with eachother. The bot was hosted on the heroku hosting platform. 

The bot allows you to create a game with another user, and will allow each user to send messages to move pieces around a board to play a game. The bot supports games with timers, and automatically checks to make sure that the user is allowed to make certain moves. Effort was put in to make sure that special rules; castling (and no castling after king moves), en passant, end game stalemates, etc. are all accounted for.

The project itself uses a chess data model I initially built for a console game, which was later rebuilt into this graphical bot-run game.
